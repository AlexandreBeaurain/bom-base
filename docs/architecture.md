# BOM-base Service Architecture

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system,
using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of
the system. It is intended to convey the significant architectural decisions
which have been made on the system.

## Goals and constraints
Goals of the BOM-base service are:
1. Automatically collect metadata for relevant packages.
2. Store metadata for non-public (inner source) packages.
3. Support human curation of stored metadata.

The stakeholders of this application are:

- Metadata experts to maintain and curate metadata.
- Bill-of-materials tool developers.

The most significant requirements are:

(TO DO)

Design constraints are:

- Maintainability: Code must be easy to maintain for average programmers. This
  is why the code tries to adhere to "Clean Code" guidelines, and a strict
layering model is applied.
